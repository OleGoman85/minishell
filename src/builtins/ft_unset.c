/**
 * ft_unset - Removes specified environment variables from 
 *     the shell's environment.
 *
 * @param t_cmd *cmd: Pointer to the command structure containing 
 * the command and its arguments.
 * @param t_shell *shell: Pointer to the shell structure representing 
 * the current state of the shell, including the environment variable list.
 *
 * This function processes the `unset` command. It iterates over each 
 * argument provided (each representing an environment 
 * variable name to be unset),
 * finds the corresponding environment variable in the shell's environment 
 * variable list, and removes it if it exists.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Extract Arguments:
 *    - Retrieve the command arguments, skipping the first argument 
 * (which is the command itself, typically "unset").
 * 
 * 2. Iterate Through Arguments:
 *    - Loop through each argument provided to the `unset` command.
 * 
 * 3. Find Environment Variable:
 *    - For each argument, use the `get_ev` function to locate the 
 * corresponding environment variable in the shell's environment list.
 * 
 * 4. Delete Environment Variable:
 *    - If the environment variable is found (`ev` is not `NULL`), 
 * call the `del_node` function to remove the environment variable 
 * node from the list and free its associated memory.
 * 
 * 5. Continue Until All Arguments Processed:
 *    - Repeat the process for all provided environment variable names.
 * 
 * 6. Return Success:
 *    - Return `EXIT_SUCCESS`, indicating that the `unset` operation 
 * completed successfully.
 * 
 * @return int: Returns `EXIT_SUCCESS` to indicate success.
